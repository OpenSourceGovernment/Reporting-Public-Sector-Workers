# Reporting Public Sector Workers
Public sector workers and contractors that engage in dishonest behaviour can be reported to OSG for investigation.  

## How to Instigate an Investigation
Before resources will be allocated to an investigation OSG requires a detailed summary of the event. The summary will be made available to OSG members who may then choose to create one or more investigatory forums. Any evidence should be produced with the summary.

## What Happens Next
OSG members will use any number of legal methods of gathering supporting evidence, the evidence will be added to the investigation forum. When the investigation forum has reached a consensus that misconduct has occured the OSG will contact the Public Office and request the individual be made responsible and removed from their position.
